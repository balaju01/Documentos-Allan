<B>Attichitcuk<B>

Attichitcuk, the father of Chewbacca, was also a powerful leader in the Wookiee community during his youth and middle years.  At 350 years old, Attichitcuk is an elder statesman, retired to the Chewbacca family tree, and content to play with his grandson Lumpy.  But in earlier times, Attichitcuk was known to lead expeditions deep into the wroshyr forest depths on dangerous honor hunts. These expeditions are an obligation of the Wookiee warrior class, and help to keep the communities safe from predators lurking below the treehouses.  Armed with only his ryyk blade, Attichitcuk once killed a pack of twenty vicious katarns.  Ever modest, Attichitcuk's achievement was only discovered when his young son found a collection of katarn dew claws, strung on a length of sinew.  As his son grew older, Attichitcuk settled down into a leadership role in the community, advising the Wookiee councils and tribes on various issues.  He became known as a peacemaker and even-handed referee during inter-tribal conflicts.

As a prominent member of the clan, Attichitcuk represented Kashyyyk in the Republic negotiations for colonization rights to Alaris Prime. Once the lengthy negotiations were concluded, Attichitcuk was awarded the honor of being part of the initial colonization force.  Once there, he encountered an illegal Trade Federation presence and assumed the mantle of warrior once again to drive them out of the Wookiees' hard-won home.  Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn arrived from Coruscant to help settle the conflict, along with his new Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Attichitcuk's next major encounter with humans would concern his son's life-debt with a young man named Han Solo. Tired of continually pronouncing the complex Wookiee name, Solo nicknamed him "Itchy." Now an older Wookie, Attichitcuk accepted the tag genially, and it was soon adopted by all those closest to him.
