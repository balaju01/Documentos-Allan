<B>Hanoon<B>

Once the barren asteroid known as Geddes, the Imperial-controlled rock called Hanoon housed several strategic bases, part of the Empire's plan to increase its presence in the Both system.  The asteroid is part of a cluster of ancient rocks caught loosely in the gravitational field of Krant.  Rich in mineral resources, Hanoon was the site of several mining outposts before the Empire moved in.  It also saw action between Rebel and Imperial forces during the short liberation of Krant.

Hanoon is a world in transition though.  Like other terraformed planets, Hanoon now has life where once there was none. Transplanted from other worlds, flora and fauna have taken hold on the new planet on the rocky expanses and newly formed seas. Rich in many valuable minerals and elements, Hanoon will one day be a thriving planet.

It is rumored that a Jedi Knight perished while destroying the Vor'Na'Tu artifact on Hanoon, but this could be pure speculation.  It is unclear how this unnamed Jedi survived the Emperor's Jedi purge, nor is it known what he or she was doing with such a powerful artifact on the once desolate planetoid.
