<B>Yavin 4<B>

The fourth moon of the gas giant Yavin has been host to more than its fair share of galactic battles and showdowns.  Millennia before the Rebellion's attack on the Death Star, the Sith Lord Naga Sadow marooned himself and his Massassi bodyguards on the planet.  The Massassi were later engaged in a massive conflict between Sith and Jedi and all perished.

Large, sprawling forests with tall canopies cover most of the humid landscape, while volcanoes dominate the rare mountain ridges.  The creatures native to Yavin 4 exist mainly in the tropical jungles, where life teems and swarms in the heat.  Whisper birds soar above the canopies while runyips root through the underbrush.  Strange mucous salamanders emerge from the water, their spongy skin hardening into a protective shell, while vicious piranha-beetles scour the air in terrifying swarms.

Despite the dangers on Yavin 4, the planet proved to be a useful hideout for Rebel forces after they fled Dantooine.  The enormous Massassi Temples housed their tactical and living quarters, as well as the small fleet of old starfighters they possessed.  The location of the base was ultimately betrayed by the Millennium Falcon, a tracking device having been attached to the starship during its stay on the Death Star.  The Yavin base was saved by Luke Skywalker, who destroyed the Death Star before the Imperials could use the battle station's superlaser to demolish Yavin 4. Unfortunately, the Yavin base ultimately fell when Darth Vader returned with ground troops and aerial bombardment.  Rebel general Jan Dodonna stayed behind during the evacuation, risking his life to set off a series of concussion charges that destroyed an entire wing of TIE bombers.
