<B>Echuu Shen-Jon<B>
 
Little is known about the Jedi named Echuu Shen-Jon other than that he survived the Emperor's purges somehow, and came to reside on Krant, whether hiding or waiting no one can be sure.

Shen-Jon met Princess Leia on Krant sometime before the Battle of Yavin, and helped her win the Krantians their freedom.  He also destroyed a Jedi artifact destined to be used for evil purposes by Darth Vader and the Emperor.

He was likely a Jedi Master or Jedi Knight around the time of the Battle of Naboo, probably a contemporary of Obi-Wan Kenobi.  The two may have even known each other.   Like Kenobi, it is probable the old Jedi lived in seclusion while waiting for a sign, something foretold by the Force.  Perhaps Shen-Jon somehow knew the young princess would arrive on the planet someday, or that he would need to defend the Vor'Na'Tu artifact , but no one can ever be sure.  The ways of the Force are indeed mysterious and strange.
