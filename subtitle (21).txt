[MUSIC] Hi, I'm Gary Burton, welcome to my
course Introduction to Improvisation. This is my instrument,
it's called a vibraphone. And it's one of the mallet
instruments like xylophone and marimba, only the vibraphone
has metal keys. And it was invented around 1930,
so it's a fairly new instrument. When I first started playing music,
I wasn't too serious about it. I was just a kid. But when I discovered jazz at about age
13, I became very passionate about it. I fell in love with the freedom and
creativity that comes with improvisation, of being part of being a jazz musician. And as you continue working on
improvisation yourself I'm sure you will come to agree that it's a wonderful experience to make up the music as you
go along and play it spontaneously. I've been very fortunate. I've had a wonderful career. I travel around the world playing
concerts and make records and I'm very grateful for
the opportunities that have come my way. I've also been very involved
in music education. And that's what brings me to
your computer screen today. I was an early proponent
of online education. And when it first became technically
possible to teach music online, I was a very enthusiastic
supporter of that as well. And in fact,
I created my own improvisation course for Berkeley College for
their continuing education division. It's called
Gary Burton Jazz Improvisation. I've been doing it for a while now, and I've learned a lot about
how online teaching works. And particularly teaching improvisation. So I thought what a good idea. I'll bring my experience and my knowledge to anyone who is
interested here at Coursera.
