<B>Mechs<B>

The so-called mech class features wildly varying units, from technological monstrosities to highly-trained animals and riders.  But all mechs serve roughly the same purpose: they are the backbone of any effective ground strike.  As generals and commanders began developing stronger anti-infantry measures, the mech emerged as a better-armored and better-armed replacement for the infantry Trooper.  The Trooper ceased to be the main ground force, and the mech began its ascent in the galactic army.  

Of special note among the mech class are the Trade Federation and Imperial technologies, which capture the best aspects of the mechanized cavalry.  The Trade Federation AAT tanks are feared throughout the galaxy for their ruthless efficiency against almost any military unit, except Aircraft.  Used to great effectiveness at the Battle of Naboo, a battalion of AATs drove back the Gungan infantry and fambaa corps and were on the verge of victory when technical glitches sabotaged their efforts.  Nevertheless, it is agreed by most historians that the tank proved its effectiveness in battle.  Additionally, the massive MTT, capable of transporting infantry troops as well, dominates any skirmish it enters.

As the Empire gradually took control of system after system, it recognized the need for fearsome but efficient vehicles to battle the various resistance groups and local rebellions.  Technicians developed the "walker" line of mechs, basing their designs on the successful 'animal cavalry' of ancient civilizations.  Maneuverability and adaptability were married to technological hardiness and reliability in the form of the AT-AT, the gargantuan flagship of the Imperial mech class.  Capable of smashing through virtually any defense, the AT-AT sports several front-mounted gun turrets, and can hold infantry troops as well.  Though slightly compromised by its weakness against Rebel armored airspeeders, the AT-AT is devastating against most military units.
