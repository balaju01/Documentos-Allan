On planets with oceans and seas, the aquatic navy has emerged as a strong component of the military machine.  The ship class was developed first as a means of transporting troops across the large expanses of water.  As transports were used more often, generals developed ships capable of sinking them: the destroyers.  The opposing forces protected their convoys with frigates.  As land-based forces began using artillery effectively, the cruiser came into existence, lobbing projectiles from the relatively safe domain of the ocean.  And finally, the anti-aircraft ship appeared, protecting the navy from aerial bombardment.

Certain civilizations specialized in their naval forces, such as the water-dwelling Gungans.  In addition to the standard ship types, the Gungans invented their Bongo submarines-stealth units capable of undetected surveillance and sudden sneak attacks.  Unless an opposing navy launches a frigate escort, a squad of Gungan submarines can wreak havoc on a convoy.  Additionally, Gungan cruisers can bombard a shoreline city and reduce it to rubble in the blink of an eye.  The wise Gungan commander launches and maintains a fully-staffed navy whenever possible.
