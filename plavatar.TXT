<B>Avatar Orbital Platform<B>

A joint venture between a Trandoshan slaver corporation and the Empire, Avatar Orbital Platform was constructed to facilitate the transport and sale of Wookiee slaves captured on the nearby planet Kashyyyk.  A source of fear and sadness for the Wookiees, Avatar was often the final stop for families before they were separated and sent to the far reaches of the galaxy.  

As with most Imperial facilities, Avatar was ugly but functional, with little regard for its very scenic locale, floating above the jewel of Kashyyyk.  The orbital station was equipped with rudimentary defenses, designed to discourage any Rebel interference in the slave trade.
