<B>Lando Calrissian<B>

The suave, debonair Lando Calrissian is mildly famous throughout a certain social strata of the galaxy.  But perhaps a better word would be 'notorious.'

Calrissian first appeared on the scene as a con artist and gambler, working the fringes of the Nar Shaddaa racket.   His talent at the sabacc table quickly amassed him a small fortune in credits and properties, and he smoothly sailed into the high-stakes world of pleasure liners and exclusive orbiting hotel-resorts.  But a run-in with a couple of hired thugs, regarding a local gangster's young and beautiful wife,  convinced Lando to light out for distant territories.

He found his way to the ornate city of Bespin, and won a freighter, the Millenium Falcon, in a round of sabacc there.  Never having learned to pilot a starship, Lando turned to one of the best star jockeys in the galaxy-Han Solo.  He caught up with Solo just in time to save him from the clutches of Boba Fett, an up and coming bounty hunter.  Lando tricked Fett, but felt his victory might be momentary.  He and Solo beat a hasty retreat, and the grateful pilot agreed to teach Lando for free. 

Many of Lando's exploits are well-known, especially among other grifters of the galaxy, and Lando certainly became one of the busiest heroes of the New Republic.  He started a mining colony, lost Bespin, fought against Grand Admiral Thrawn, was a member of Mon Mothma's task force, ran a spy mission on Kessel, and acted as a General under Admiral Ackbar's command, to name just a few of his adventures.  No matter what, Lando remains a solid friend of the Rebellion, a far cry from the scoundrel he once was.
