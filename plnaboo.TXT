<B>Naboo<B>

A glittering jewel in the Outer Rim, Naboo is renowned throughout the galaxy as a center for peace and learning.  Its beautiful cities exist in harmony with the surrounding green grasslands and rolling hills.  The climate is temperate, and the more dangerous predators are relegated mainly to Naboo's unique watery core.  Unlike most planets, which have molten lava for their core, Naboo is hollow, and filled with oceans running through its center.  It is in these deep waters that the ferocious Sando Aqua and Opee Sea Killers are found.

In addition to the human Naboo, there is a civilized indigenous species: the Gungans.  Unlike the peace-loving Naboo, the Gungans maintain a standing army, and have been known to clash with each other in intertribal conflict.  Mostly the Gungan Bosses keep the peace, and there is time to concentrate on the finer things, such as the continual refinement of the hydrostatic bubble technology that supports their underwater cities.  At one point, although the Naboo and Gungans were not in active conflict, there was undeniable tension between them, and they rarely mixed.

The peaceful Naboo were taken utterly by surprise when the Trade Federation launched an illegal invasion of their planet, and took control of the governing bodies.  Many Naboo perished under the harsh rule of the Neimoidian Viceroy.  The Queen ultimately forged an alliance with the Gungans and a dual-pronged retaliatory attack was launched to free Naboo and capture the Viceroy.
