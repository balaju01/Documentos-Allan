<B>Kessel<B>

The galaxy's constant demand for highly-addictive glitterstim has fueled development on Kessel, which is showing no signs of abating.  The reddish misshapen planetoid lacks a breathable atmosphere, and boasts arid alkaline fields, active volcanoes and dangerous predators.  Nevertheless, the profit on glitterstim is more than enough to justify the addition of massive oxygen-producing factories that continually pump out breathable air, only to have it lost in Kessel's thin atmosphere and low gravity.

Although the Empire officially controlled Kessel and its spice production, smugglers and gangsters regularly made runs back and forth, shipping the glitterstim to Tatooine and other remote worlds for distribution.  Complicating the smuggling operations were the number of nearby black holes that make a straight shot to Kessel difficult.  Captain Han Solo once boasted his ship made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs, meaning he must have passed dangerously close to one of the black holes to shortcut his journey.

Kessel was also the site of a high-security Imperial prison and labor camp, hosting some of the galaxy's most dangerous criminals.  The prisoners were forced to work deep in the spice mines, under brutal conditions, for the profit of the Empire.  As the New Republic moved to capture Coruscant, sixteen of the worst thugs were rescued from Kessel by Rogue Squadron, and set loose on Coruscant to wreak havoc and distract the remnants of the Empire.
