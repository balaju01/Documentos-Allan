Welcome to lesson three of
Introduction to Music Business. This lesson is gonna deal
with Copyright Basics. I say that the copyright is the most
valuable asset in the music industry because it gives the author
of the work a monopoly on those works. For a certain period of time. In this lesson we're gonna cover
some very important topics. The history of copyright, how
the Copyright Act was enacted in 1790, and over the course of the past 200 and more
years, the copyright has been amended to change the term of copyright, add
certain rights and types of copyrights. We're gonna talk about the four
primary income generating rights in the copyright in the composition,
which are the Mechanical right, the right of Public Performance,
Synchronization And the Derivative right. We'll discuss how to register your
copyrights with the US Copyright Office. Why it's so important to do that, and why it's the best way to
protect your creative works. We'll discuss the infringement
of copyright. What happens if somebody
infringes on your copyright and doesn't get your permission
before they use your copyright. We'll talk about the various enforcement,
and the remedies that you have as a result
of having a US copyright registration. At lastly, we'll talk about Fair Use,
which is a defense and a very important concept
in today's music business. So hold on to your seats,
pay close attention. We're gonna cover some very important
information to make sure you get paid not played.
