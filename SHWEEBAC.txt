<B>Weebacca<B>
 
Weebacca was known in his clan for being a small Wookiee with a big Wookiee's attitude.  Although he and Chewbacca were friends growing up in the village, Weebacca could be untrustworthy and petty at times.  But he was loyal to Chewie and the two were never in conflict, despite whatever trouble Weebacca was currently in.

It didn't take long for the diminutive Wookiee to find his way into the smuggling and gambling game.   Weebacca loved sabacc and always seemed short of money.  In desperate need of large sums of credits, he would take any job, no matter how dangerous.  So, like many Wookiees, Weebacca became a bodyguard-for-hire.  For a long period of time, Weebacca had no contact with any of his relatives or his friend Chewbacca.  He eventually resurfaced, running spice through the Kashyyyk system, under the nose of the Imperial patrols.  He hated the Empire and when his home planet was invaded and enslaved, he dropped his lucrative smuggling career and rushed home to help.
