<B>Boss Gallo<B>
 
A long time ago, over 3,000 years before the Battle of Naboo, the Gungan people were scattered, split into bickering, warring tribes and clans.  Boss Gallo of Otoh Sancture, however, refused to war against his fellow Gungans. He believed it was prohibited by the gods, and was immoral.  No good thing can come of Gungan war, he often said.

Consequently, Otoh Sancture remained neutral through all the strife, and became a hub of trade and commerce, and gossip and spying.  The city reaped the benefits of being a way-station and a go-between for all the Gungan tribes, and Boss Gallo's wealth grew.  But another powerful Gungan, Boss Rogoe, feared Boss Gallo would not stay neutral forever.  Sooner or later, Rogoe reasoned, Gallo would pick a side, and tip the balance in its favor.  Rogoe determined he had to strike against Otoh Sancture before Boss Gallo had the chance to prepare for war.  Using a proxy strike force of wild bursas, Rogoe attacked and destroyed Otoh Sancture, yet managed to appear still innocent.  Unfortunately, one of Rogoe's agents, in charge of leading the bursas to Otoh Sancture, remained in the area too long, and was discovered by Boss Gallo.

From that point on, Rogoe's eventual destruction was assured, as Boss Gallo slowly brought together his Gungan allies and focused his armies on the deceitful warlord.  The final attack came at Spearhead, Rogoe's main stronghold.  From the ashes of Rogoe's defeat, Boss Gallo built the vast underwater city designed to unite all Gungan tribes:  Otoh Gunga.
