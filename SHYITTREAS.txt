<B>Moff Yittreas<B>

The so-called "Butcher of Krant," Moff Yittreas ruled unchecked on the remote planet of Krant and its asteroid Hanoon during the final years of the Empire.  The Krantians feared him greatly, and he was allowed by Imperial leadership to conduct his affairs as he saw fit.  Grand Moff Tarkin considered the man a somewhat unstable sociopath, but recognized his excellent management skills and gave him his own system to rule.

The two men were contemporaries, but where Tarkin's political and military savvy covered his more bloodthirsty deeds, Yittreas was all raw ambition.  The dictator oversaw the deaths of thousands of Krantians for trumped-up charges of "political treason," essentially paring down the population so he would not have to increase the size of his garrison.  Eventually he became embroiled in a Krantian Civil War, and lost the planet to the Rebel Alliance.  He escaped to his nearby asteroid stronghold, and began terraforming and developing the rock for Imperial colonization.  The asteroid began fully functioning as a mobile battle station.

Yittreas clashed again with the Rebel Alliance ten years later, over the remaining shards of a Jedi artifact.  This time, however, there would be no escape.
