<B>Queen Amidala<B>

Born in a humble mountain village, Queen Amidala was identified early for her intelligence, patience, and wisdom.  She entered special schools and was groomed for public service in traditional Naboo fashion.

Amidala was elected Princess and Supervisor of Theed at the age of 12, and immediately impressed everyone with her maturity and thoughtfulness.  While King Veruna ruled above her, Amidala became a favorite of the Naboo people and the citizens of Theed, who considered her their 'daughter.'  Though fame wore her down, she appreciated the love and admiration of Theed and always tried to return the affection through fair and helpful policies.

When Veruna unexpectedly abdicated the throne,  Amidala was a natural choice to succeed him.  She won the election in an unprecedented landslide, and she was, curiously, not the youngest person to ever take the throne. 

Amidala's fortitude was quickly put to the test when the Trade Federation moved in with an illegal blockade.  She showed bravery and resourcefulness, escaping the planet to inform the Senate, then returning when unsatisfied with the slow response of the governing body.  Taking matters into her own hands, Amidala organized a unified attack with the Gungan Army, and succeeded in capturing the Neimoidian Viceroy and taking back her planet.
