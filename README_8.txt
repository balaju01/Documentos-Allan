General Information
--------------------

If Launcher Screen is Too Large for Screen
-------------------------------------------
If your font size is set to "Large Fonts," the launcher will
appear to be twice as large as it should be and you may not be
able to see all of the launcher buttons. We suggest you set
your fonts to "Small" to see the entire launcher.

To do so:
* Right-click on your desktop
* Click on "Properties"
* Click on the "Settings" tab
* Click on the box under "Font size" near the bottom
* Click on "Small Fonts"
* Click on the "OK" button at the bottom of the window


Desktop Color Palette
---------------------
We recommend that you set your desktop to High Color (16 bit)
color.  When playing Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds with
your desktop set to a color palette other than 16-bit, you
may experience various problems while running the game.


Task Switching
--------------
We recommend that you do not task switch while the opening
movie is running or during screen transitions while playing
Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds. You may experience various
minor issues when task switching from these locations.


CTRL-ESC
--------
We recommend that you do not use CTRL-ESC while playing
Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds.


Installing Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds
-------------------------------------------
Insert the Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds CD into your 
CD-ROM drive. The Launcher screen will open automatically
unless Autoplay is disabled. If it does not, double-click
on the My Computer icon, then the CD-ROM icon. This should
bring up the launcher menu. If it does not, double-click 
on Battlegrounds.exe in the window that opens. Click on the
top button from the following options and the installer 
will guide you through the installation process. Installation
requires 500 MB of free hard drive.


Running Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds
----------------------------------------
To run the game, click on your Start Menu, select Programs,
then LucasArts, then Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds and click
on Play Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds. This will bring up
the Launcher screen. Click on Start Game on the launcher and 
it will begin the game.

Although it is possible to run the executable directly off of
the CD, we recommend that you use the shortcuts the installer
creates in the Start Menu or the shortcut to Star Wars Galactic
Battlegrounds, which is created on the desktop during custom
installation. Running the executable directly from the CD may
cause the game to run more slowly while it accesses the CD much
more often.

We provide minimal support for both the Microsoft
Voice Commander, and Strategic Commander. You will find 
instructions in the Installed "Extras" folder located at:

you will need to modify this path accordingly.

General Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds Information
----------------------------------------------------

Task Switching Causes Camera To Displace
----------------------------------------
When task switching, the camera may be displaced on the map
after tasking back into the game. When this occurs, just
click on the mini-map to return focus to the correct 
location on the map. 

Copying Player, Campaigns And Scenarios To Other Computer
---------------------------------------------------------
To transfer your player name and progress, you will need to
copy the Player.nfx from the folder where Star Wars Galactic
Battlegrounds is installed to the same location on the computer
where you wish to play the game. When you copy Player.nfx to a
computer that already contains a Player.nfx file, we recommend
that you rename the file on the computer where you are copying
the files so you do not overwrite the existing Player.nfx and
lose the campaign information.

To transfer campaigns, you need to copy the *.cpx files from
the Campaign folder to the Campaign folder, which is located
in the Game folder on the other computer. To transfer your
scenarios, copy the *.scx files from the Scenario folder to
the same folder on the second computer.

Maximum Filename Length For User-Created Scenarios
--------------------------------------------------
The maximum filename length for user-created scenarios is 
37 characters. If a filename exceeds this limit, other users
will be unable to download and play the scenario.

Terrain Changes Do Not Appear On Mini-Map
-----------------------------------------
When working with the terrain Tools interface, if a player 
other than player one is selected, terrain changes will not 
be displayed on the mini-map.

Difficult To Build Shipyards
----------------------------
When attempting to build shipyards, you need to place the 
shipyard in shallow water tiles. It is important to remember
this when working with water in the editor.

LAN Game Has Internet Message
-----------------------------
When you create a multiplayer game, you will receive a message
saying "Press ESC if the game is not created in 15 seconds. 
Also, make sure you are connected to the Internet before 
starting Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds." Note: you do not 
need to connect to the Internet if you are starting a LAN 
game.

Turning Off Cheat Codes
-----------------------
To turn off the cheat code you have activated simply type in 
the same cheat code again to turn it off.

Destroyer Droids Are Listed As Detector Units
---------------------------------------------
In the help text for the Destroyer Droid located in the 
Fortress it states that the Destroyer droid is a detector
unit. This is not the case.

Capacity Upgrade For Air Transport
----------------------------------
The tool tip for the Air transport mentions an upgrade to 
increase capacity located in the Air Base. This upgrade does 
not exist.
