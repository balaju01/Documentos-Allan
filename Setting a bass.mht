you should use for setting, checking and adjusting your bass or guitar's

<h1><span style=3D'font-size:17.5pt'>What Is Guitar Intonation?<o:p></o:p><=
/span></h1>

</div>

<p><span style=3D'font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>Intonation is the accuracy =
in
which a guitar or bass guitar can produce a fretted note. Setting the
intonation is the act of adjusting the length of the strings (by moving the
bridge saddles) to compensate for the stretching of a string due to pushing=
 it
down to the fret board to produce a note. To adjust the intonation of your
guitar or bass, you move the bridge saddles toward or away from the fret bo=
ard
until the 12th fret octave and its harmonic are equal and the same open-str=
ing
note is exactly one octave below those. Accurate intonation is critical to
sound quality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=3D'font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>When a guitar or bass guita=
r has
an inaccurate intonation setting, you may notice that chords played at the
bottom of the neck sound correct, but the same chord played higher up the f=
ret
board have some notes that become out of tune, making the chords sound more
like noise than music. An example is that you may play an open A on the 5th=
 (or
3rd) string together with the same note on the 6th (or 4th) string to add
depth. If these notes aren't <b>exactly</b> the same, you may think that yo=
ur
instrument is out of tune. That is what this article will try to help you
correct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h1><span style=3D'font-size:17.5pt'>Check Your Guitar or Bass Intonation<o=
:p></o:p></span></h1>

</div>

<p><span style=3D'font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>Checking intonation is easy,
especially if you have a digital tuner. The best tuners to use for this task
are the ones with a meter readout rather than LEDs since it is much easier =
to
see how much adjustment may need to be done. You must also be sure that your
strings are new, but you should check your intonation periodically just to =
be
sure that it is correct. First, you must tune your guitar to your desired
tuning. Each time you change strings or tunings, your strings' tension or
height may change slightly, which may unset your intonation.<o:p></o:p></sp=
an></p>

<p><span style=3D'font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>With your instrument in the=
 same
position as you normally play (playing position), not lying on a table, che=
ck
the tuning of the natural harmonic at the 12th fret (gently touching the st=
ring
above the 12th fret while picking). This should be exactly equal to the tun=
ing
if you were to push the string down to the fret. If they are the same and y=
ou
still have intonation problems, check the open strings and the other fretted
notes. If particular frets are out of tune while others are in tune across =
each
string, the frets on your instrument may be worn to the point where the str=
ing is
not contacting the centers of the frets. If that is the case, you may need =
to
grind and polish or replace the worn frets to cure this problem.<o:p></o:p>=
</span></p>

<p><span style=3D'font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>If the intonation starts ou=
t bad
on the first few frets and gets progressively better going up to the 12th f=
ret,
your guitar may have a misplaced nut. This would throw the entire scale of =
your
guitar or bass guitar off. It is suggested that you have an instrument repa=
ir
person replace the nut to ensure that it is in the correct position. If you=
 do
have the nut replaced by a repair person, be sure to check their job thorou=
ghly
before leaving the shop - even if you have to completely set the intonation
right there! If the problem still exists, be sure to explain it to the repa=
ir
person (you may want to explain the problem before repairs are done as well=
).
Some cheaply made guitars may never be able to correct this problem, but if=
 you
are paying to have the nut replaced, be sure what they have done the best j=
ob
possible - before handing over your hard-earned cash.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

nation<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

</div>

<p><span style=3D'font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>Because adjustments such as
action (the height of the strings from the fret board), truss rod tightness,
string thickness or material and the magnetic pull of your pickups can effe=
ct
an instrument's intonation, adjustments must be performed as the last step =
in
setting up your guitar or bass guitar. When you are checking the intonation=
 of
your instrument, it must be done in your normal playing position in order to
correctly account for any neck flex which effects the string height (action=
).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=3D'font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>Adjusting an instrument's
intonation consists of setting the bridge saddles to produce the note at the
12th fret exactly an octave higher than that of the open string. With the a=
id
of an electronic or digital tuner, compare either the open string or the oc=
tave
harmonic at the 12th fret with the fretted octave at the 12th fret. Use sli=
ght
finger pressure, as any extra pressure (&quot;articulation&quot;) will disr=
upt
the accuracy of the adjustment. If the fretted note is sharp, move the sadd=
le
away from the pickups and fret board; if it is flat, move the saddle toward=
 the
pickups and fret board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=3D'font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>If you periodically check y=
our
intonation, adjustments should rarely take more than a few minutes, provided
you stick with the same tuning, action and string gauges. Check the intonat=
ion
every time you change your strings, especially if you are changing tunings,
gauges, or even brands. Even the slightest differences between sets of stri=
ngs
can make a noticeable difference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=3D'font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>If your bridge does not pro=
vide
you with enough adjustment, it may be necessary to have a repair person tak=

look. Sometimes it may be as simple as the saddle needs to be turned around=
 and
re-slotted. In some more extreme cases, the entire bridge may need to be mo=

<h1><span style=3D'font-size:17.5pt'>Factors Causing Inaccurate Or Poor
Intonation On A Guitar Or Bass Guitar<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

</div>

<p><span style=3D'font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>If your guitar or bass guit=
ar has
poor intonation, you may want to check factors such as your action, bridge
saddles or worn frets. The action of your instrument may cause your intonat=
ion
to be sharp - the higher the action is, the more the strings need to be
stretched in order to fret a note. If your bridge saddles are worn or leani=
ng,
that may effect the action of your instrument as well as the shorten a stri=
ng's
life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=3D'font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>One other factor that has c=
ome up
much more often in the last few years involves low tunings. Guitars and bass
guitars are made to handle a range of string thicknesses. These string gaug=
es
can only produce a certain number of notes. Lower notes will not only loosen
the string, but may require you to raise your action to prevent fret buzz. =
In
doing so, you will also make your intonation sharper, possibly causing your
bridge saddles to run out of adjustment room. If this is the case, you may
(though it is not recommended) need to move your entire bridge away from the
nut in order to gain the additional adjustment room required to set your
intonation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=3D'font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>Before you consider moving =
the
bridge, try a thicker gauge string (I know many guitarists that use a bass
string in place of their low string). If this still doesn't work for you, g=
et a
new instrument that can support what you want. For instance, spend the cash=
 to
get a 5-string bass or a baritone or 7-string guitar if you have to. After =
all,
homemade, custom-built guitars don't always have an accurate scale, and may
cost just as much as a new mass-produced guitar by the time you buy all the
pieces. (Trust me, I know this from experience!)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
