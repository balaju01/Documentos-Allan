Click on the \b +\b0  (plus sign) next to a feature to see all its related pages. The settings will appear in the window to the right of the menu tree. Information about these options and instructions on how to change them will appear here in this information box. You can use the scroll bar to view the contents of the information box.\par
\par
\b Defaults Button\b0\par
The \b Defaults\b0  button returns all the settings on the current page back to their factory-set values.\par
\par
\b OK Button\b0\par
The \b OK\b0  button saves your changes and closes the Properties window.\par
\par
\b Cancel Button\b0\par
The \b Cancel\b0  button closes the Properties window without saving any changes and reverts to all the previous settings.\par
\par
\b Apply Button\b0\par
The \b Apply\b0  button saves your changes, but keeps the Properties window open so you can make more changes.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=1\cf0\par
The \b Enable buttons\b0  check box enables the "mouse" buttons for this pointing device. To configure the action performed when you press a button, select the name of the button from the menu tree. For example, you could define the right button to "go to a web page in your default browser."  Each time you click the right button on your pointing device, your web browser would automatically open and load the specified page.\par
\par
When \b Enable buttons\b0  is not selected, the buttons are disabled and pressing them has no effect; tapping is the only way to click with your pointing device.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=2\cf0\par
\b Scroll item under pointer\b0\par
Select this option if you want to scroll the window or item that is under the pointer. With this option you do not need to click on a window first in order to scroll it.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=3\cf0\par
Select an action from the list above to assign it to the selected button. The selected action will occur every time you press the button.\par
\par
If you are unable to select an action from the list, ensure the buttons are enabled. To enable the buttons, perform the following steps:\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-180\li180\tx180\par
1.\tab Select \b Buttons\b0  in the menu tree to the left.\par
2.\tab Select the \b Enable buttons\b0  check box.\par

This button brings up a configuration dialog box pertaining to the action selected in the list box.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=5\cf0\par
The \b Press-to-Select\b0  feature allows you to use tapping and pressing motions to perform "mouse" clicks.\par
\par
Tapping or pressing on the tip of the pointing stick is the same as clicking the left mouse button. However, tapping or pressing can be quicker and more convenient than using the mouse button.\par
\par
"Tapping" means quickly striking and then releasing your finger from the top of the pointing stick. A light, quick tap works best. Very hard or slow taps are less effective. Tap once for a single click, or twice in rapid succession for a double-click.\par
\par
"Pressing" means swiftly pushing down on the top of the pointing stick with your finger. A light, deliberate press works best. Press straight down to simulate clicking and holding the mouse button. Press straight down and then to the side to click-and-drag in any direction. Release the pressure when you want to release the mouse button.\par
\par
Select the \b Enable Press-to-Select\b0  check box to enable this feature.\par
\par
The physical buttons can also be used to click; if you clear this check box, the physical buttons are the only way to click.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=6\cf0\par
This menu tree lists the options for your pointing device. To configure an option, click on the entry corresponding to the option.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=7\cf0\par
The \b Pointer Motion\b0  settings pages allow you to specify how the "mouse" pointer on the screen moves in response to your pointing actions.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=8\cf0\par
The \b Constrained Motion\b0  feature allows you to force purely horizontal or vertical motion of the pointer on the screen. This feature is most useful when using a drawing program. You activate Constrained Motion by pressing and holding a specified key while moving the pointer. When the key is pressed, the initial direction of your pointer motion determines the allowed direction of movement for as long as your finger remains on the TouchPad.\par
\par
To enable the Constrained Motion feature:\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-180\li180\tx180\par
1.\tab Select the \b Enable constrained motion\b0  check box to enable the options in the list box.\par
2.\tab Choose a key from the list box for activating Constrained Motion.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\tx180\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=9\cf0\par
\b Press-to-Select means left click\b0\par
This option produces a left mouse click when you tap or press on the pointing stick. A right mouse click is generally used to display a context pop up menu.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=10\cf0\par
These keys can be used to activate the Constrained Motion mode. Select the key of your choice by clicking on the entry in the list box.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=11\cf0\par
The \b EdgeMotion\b0\'99 feature is designed to simplify long-distance pointer motions. When your finger reaches the edge of the TouchPad, the pointer will continue to move in the same direction until you lift your finger. Select one of the EdgeMotion options.\par

\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=13\cf0\par
\b Perform EdgeMotion when dragging and pointing\b0\par
When this option is selected, EdgeMotion occurs whenever your finger reaches the edge of the TouchPad.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=14\cf0\par
\b No EdgeMotion\b0\par
To move the pointer a long distance without EdgeMotion, you must make repeated finger strokes on the pad or increase the pointer motion speed in the Mouse Control Panel.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=15\cf0\par
By selecting the \b Enable Tap Zones\b0  check box, you can configure each of the four corners of the TouchPad surface to act as different buttons when tapped. These corner regions are called \b Tap Zones\b0 .\par
\par

\b Record and Play a Keyboard Macro\b0\par
\par
This action plays a pre-recorded sequence of keystrokes. After selecting this action you can record the sequence of keystrokes to play.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=87\cf0\par
\b Keyboard Macro Recording Dialog\b0\par
This dialog allows you to record a sequence of keystrokes for subsequent playback. Such a recorded keystroke sequence is often called a keyboard \i macro\i0 .\par
\par
To begin recording a macro, press the \b Start\b0  button. The \b Stop\b0  button will then be enabled and the \b Start\b0  button disabled indicating that recording is in progress. Since all keystrokes will be intercepted during recording, the only way to exit from the recording mode is to press the Stop button using the mouse.\par
\par
When not recording, the \b Clear\b0  button can be used to empty the recorded keystroke buffer. When recording, this button serves the function of the backspace key. Pressing the \b Back\b0  button removes the last entry from the recorded keystroke buffer. Note that during recording, the \b Back\b0  button must be pressed with the mouse.\par
\par
As they are recorded, keystrokes also appear in the recording dialog\rquote s text window. Alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation keys appear in the text window just as they would appear in a typed document. Non-printable keys are represented in the text window by mnemonic tags enclosed in braces.\par
\par
To make the text window easier to read, most keys are only placed into the text window as they are pressed. However the mode keys (such as \b Shift\b0 , \b Ctrl\b0  and \b Alt\b0 ) are entered into the text window both when they are pressed and when they are released. This makes it possible to locate keyboard mode changes by \ldblquote reading\rdblquote  the text window.\par
\par
Please note that the text window is not directly editable. For instance, it is not possible to insert a key in the middle of a previously recorded sequence. To do this, you must clear the recorded buffer and re-record the desired keystroke sequence.\par
\par
Once a recording is completed, press the \b OK\b0  button to save or the \b Cancel\b0  button to discard your recording. Pressing either button will exit the dialog.\par

\par
You can also specify a different action to be performed when you press a button. For example, you could define the right button to "go to a web page in your default browser". Each time you click the right button on your pointing device, your web browser would automatically open and load the specified page.\par
\par

\par
\b Settings\b0\par
If the selected feature displays a settings icon that highlights when you hover the pointer over it, you can click it or double-click on the feature's name to configure its settings. If you cannot click a settings icon, ensure the features checkbox and any parent checkboxes are checked.\par
\par
\b Help\b0\par
The question mark icon and Help button can be clicked to display help information.\par
\par
\b Close Button\b0\par
The Close button on the settings window closes the window. The changes will become permanent only after clicking \b Apply\b0  or \b OK\b0  on the Properties window.\par
\par

\b Scrolling speed\b0\par
The Scrolling speed slider allows you to adjust the speed of scrolling. Drag the slider to the right for faster scrolling.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=391\cf0\par
\b Pointing\b0\par
The Pointing settings pages enable you to specify how the cursor responds to your pointing and selection actions.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=392\cf0\par
\b Touch Sensitivity\b0\par
The Touch Sensitivity slider allows you to adjust how much finger pressure must be applied before the TouchPad responds.\par
\par
If your pointer is moving or clicking erratically, or you work in an area with high humidity, decrease sensitivity by moving the slider toward \b Heavy Touch\b0 .\par
\par
If you have to press too hard to operate the TouchPad or if the TouchPad does not always respond to your taps, increase sensitivity by moving the slider toward \b Light Touch\b0 .\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=393\cf0\par
\b Tap Zones\b0\par
The Tap Zone diagram represents the surface of the TouchPad. The cross-hatched area on the diagram shows the active Tap Zone regions on the TouchPad surface. When you place your finger on the TouchPad, arrows appear along the edge of the TouchPad diagram to show your finger's position. If your finger is in an active Tap Zone region on the TouchPad, the corresponding Tap Zone area on the diagram becomes a solid color.\par
\par
You can make the Tap Zone regions larger or smaller by dragging one of the small black squares on the corners of the cross-hatched areas. If you have difficulty triggering a Tap Zone action, make the Tap Zone region larger. If a Tap Zone action triggers too easily, make the Tap Zone region smaller.\par
\par
If the Tap Zones are gray and cannot be adjusted, ensure that \b Enable Tap Zones\b0  checkbox is selected.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=394\cf0\par
\b Press-to-Select\b0\par
The Press-to-Select feature allows you to use tapping and pressing motions to perform mouse clicks.\par
\par
Tapping or pressing on the tip of the pointing stick is the same as clicking the left mouse button. However, tapping or pressing can be quicker and more convenient than using the mouse button.\par
\par
Tapping means quickly striking and then releasing your finger from the top of the pointing stick. A light, quick tap works best. Very hard or slow taps are less effective. Tap once for a single click, or twice in rapid succession for a double-click.\par
\par
Pressing means swiftly pushing down on the top of the pointing stick with your finger. A light, deliberate press works best. Press straight down to simulate clicking and holding the mouse button. Press straight down and then to the side to click-and-drag in any direction. Release the pressure when you want to release the mouse button.\par
\par
The physical buttons can also be used to click; if you clear this check box, the physical buttons are the only way to click.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=395\cf0\par
\b Press to select only\b0\par
When this option is selected, pressing on the tip of the Pointing Stick selects the object, but will not open or move it.\par
\par
\b Press to select drag\b0\par
When this option is selected, pressing on the tip of the pointing stick selects the object and keeps it selected so you can move it with the pointing stick. It is the equivalent of pressing and holding the left mouse button.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=396\cf0\par
\b Press-to-Select means Primary Click\b0\par
When this option is selected, pressing on the pointing stick performs the same action as a primary mouse click.\par
\par
\b Press-to-Select means Secondary Click\b0\par
When this option is selected, pressing on the pointing stick performs the same action as a secondary mouse click.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=397\cf0\par
\b Pace\b0\par
The Pace slider adjusts how fast you must press on the pointing stick for it to be considered a Press to Select. Adjust the pace slider until your presses register easily. If presses do not occur, move it towards \b Fast\b0. If too many presses occur, move it towards \b Slow\b0.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=398\cf0\par
\b Touch Sensitivity\b0\par
Sensitivity settings allow you to control how much pressure you must exert on the pointing stick to move the pointer at a particular speed.\par

\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=403\cf0\par
When Slow Motion is enabled, you can choose a key from the list box that will activate it. To use Slow Motion, press and hold the specified key while moving the pointer.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=404\cf0\par
When constrained motion is enabled, you can choose a key from the list box that will activate it. To use constrained motion, press and hold the specified key while moving the pointer.

\b Cover Gesture\b0\par
This gesture clears your desktop by minimizing all open windows. Repeating this gesture restores the windows.\par
\par
To use the Cover Gesture:\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi-180\li180\tx180\par
1.\tab Place your four fingers flat on the TouchPad so that most of it is covered.\par
2.\tab Hold your fingers still until the windows have been minimized or restored.\par

\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=407\cf0\par
You can press anywhere on the ClickPad to perform a primary, secondary, or middle button click.\par 
\par
By default, pressing one finger down performs a primary click. Pressing two fingers down performs a secondary click. Pressing three fingers down performs a middle button click. Select \b Two-Finger Click \b0 and \b Three-Finger Click \b0 to configure as desired.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=408\cf0\par
To perform a one-finger click, press one finger down on the ClickPad surface until you feel it descend. A one-finger click is equivalent to clicking a primary (left) mouse button.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=409\cf0\par
By default, a one-finger click in the lower right corner of the CickPad performs the same action as a secondary (right) mouse click.\par
\par
The action performed by a one-finger corner click is configurable.  To assign a different action, select an action from the list.\par
\par
Some actions require additional configuration. If more information is required, the \b Configure \b0 button will become enabled or a dialog box will appear.\par
\par
You can click the \b Configure \b0 button at any time to view or change your settings.\par
\par
If you are in Left-handed configuration, click in the lower left side of the ClickPad.\par

\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=408\cf0\par
To perform a one-finger click, press one finger down on the ClickPad surface until you feel it descend. A one-finger click is equivalent to clicking a primary (left) mouse button.\par
\par
\cf1 ##HelpTopicID=409\cf0\par

\par
Some actions require additional configuration. If more information is required, the \b Configure \b0 button will become enabled or a dialog box will appear.\par
\par
You can click the \b Configure \b0 button at any time to view or change your settings.\par

Za po\'e8etak snimanja makra pritisnite gumb \b Start\b0 . Gumb \b Zaustavi \b0\'e6e tada biti omogu\'e6en, a gumb \b Start\b0  onemogu\'e6en ukazuju\'e6i na to da je snimanje u tijeku. S obzirom da \'e6e izvr\'9aiti presretanje svakog pritiska na tipku tijekom snimanja, jedini na\'e8in za izlaz iz re\'9eima snimanja je da pritisnete gumb Zaustavi kori\'9atenjem mi\'9aa.\par

Tipke koje se ne ispisuju se u tekstualnom prozoru reprezentiraju mnemoni\'e8kim oznakama ogra\'f0enim zagradama.\par
\par
Kako bi tekstualni prozor bio \'9ato lak\'9ai za \'e8itanje, ve\'e6ina tipki se postavlja u prozor samo pri njihovom pritisku. Me\'f0utim, tipke re\'9eima (poput \b Shift\b0 , \b Ctrl\b0  i \b Alt\b0 ) su unose u tekstualni prozor i kada se pritisnu i kada ih se otpusti. To omogu\'e6ava lociranje promjena tipkovnice "\'e8itanjem" tekstualnog prozora.\par
\par
Imajte na umu da tekstualni prozor nije izravno urediv. Primjerice, nije mogu\'e6e umetnuti tipku u sredinu prethodno snimljenog niza. Da biste to napravili, morate o\'e8istiti snimljeni me\'f0uspremnik i ponovno snimiti \'9eeljeni niz tipki.\par
