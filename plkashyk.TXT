<B>Kashyyyk<B>

Visitors to Kashyyyk are initially awed by the enormous wroshyr trees, in whose branches the Wookiees make their homes and cities.  Awe turns to trepidation when they are warned of the lower levels of the tree canopies, where vicious predators like the katarn exist.  Even further down, where the sunlight can no longer penetrate, an unlucky traveler might meet fanged bioluminescent hunters, and other creatures so disgusting the Wookiees are reluctant to even name them.

The giant furred warriors known as Wookiees are the planet's most-developed lifeform.  The Wookiees have a complex social system based on honor, respect for the environment, and the notion of the 'life-debt', a pledge sworn by a Wookiee to another being affirming his lifelong loyalty and protection.  Chewbacca swore such a debt to Han Solo, after the young pirate rescued him from one of the many Trandoshan slaving camps.

The reptilian Trandoshans occupy another planet in the Kashyyyk system, but the two societies maintain an ancient feud.  More recently, with the help of the Empire, the Trandoshans intensified  the conflict, conducting raids to enslave the Wookiee population.  The strong, technically-proficient species make for excellent workers, once the Empire breaks their independent spirits.  It was the ex-slave Chewbacca who finally returned to Kashyyyk, overthrew the Empire, and freed his people.
