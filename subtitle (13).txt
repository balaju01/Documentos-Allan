Let's talk about the Free Goods Deduction. The Free Goods Deduction. In the physical market with CDs, record companies sell these
products to retailers. And the sales people at
the record company's job is to sell as many of the CDs
to retailers as possible. Sometimes to do that they have to give something to the retailers
to entice them to buy more CDs. For instance, let's say that a retailer wants to buy 75 copies of one album. Because they think the album is
going to sell in their stores, and they could at least sell 75 copies. So they go to place an order with the
sales person from the record company and they say, I want to purchase 75
copies of that particular album. Usually record company sales people are in
the position to say, wait a minute, I'm gonna offer you a deal. Why don't you buy 100? Place an order for 100 instead of 75 and
if you do, I'm gonna give you 15 copies more, I'm gonna give you 115
copies, but you're only purchasing 100. Those extra 15 are called free goods. And record companies don't pay
royalties to the artist for free goods. Now, record companies have a legitimate
concern in that they're trying to get the retailer to buy more. And so they feel that they have to have these
kinds of incentives to sell more product. So record companies routinely
have provisions stating that they don't have to pay royalties for
these free goods. They can give away a certain
number of free goods that they don't have to pay royalties on. Usually the artist's
attorney will try to limit the percentage of free goods that
they give to maybe 10% or 15%. So in other words,
they don't want them to give 25 more or 30 more on an order of 100. But maybe just 15 more.
