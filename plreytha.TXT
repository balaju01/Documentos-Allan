<B>Reytha<B>

Several planets have the rare distinction of being devoted entirely to food production and exportation, and Reytha is foremost among them.  The unique microclimates existing on Reytha encourage the multi-season growth of most major food crops.  During the height of Imperial production, special synthesizers and genetic inducer-droids were introduced to further boost production, giving the planet the nickname of "breadbasket of the Empire." 

Still ruled by a local governor, Reytha's main settlement is located at Yeere, which has historically been the site of major fortresses and strongholds.  The almost exclusively agrarian nature of Reytha has discouraged crime and smuggling elements, who find the planet 'too boring' to infiltrate.

Reytha's climate is cooled by the enormous Montrosa Ocean, which is dotted by the Montrosa Island chain.  The pleasant climate of the islands attracts Mon Calamari star tours and other leisure cruises, but the islands are considered too small and isolated for major development.
