<B>Captain Marsune<B>
 
A legendary figure in Gungan history, Captain Marsune lived approximately 3,000 years before the Battle of Naboo, during a time of great civil strife among the Gungan tribes. Marsune began his career as a folk hero to the local Gungans, robbing the greedier Bosses of their riches, and distributing the wealth among the poorer tribes.  Mostly he and his band of rogues kept to themselves, preferring the sanctuary of the Naboo swamps and forest.  Marsune's reverence for the spirits of the land was well-known and admired.  His life among the forest creatures brought him great joy and peace.

Marsune's independent existence was complicated by the appearance of Boss Gallo, who asked the rogue for help, after the destruction of Otoh Sancture.  Not wishing to get too deeply involved, Marsune agreed to a simple exchange of worker Glurrgs for food.  But when rival Boss Rogoe's participation in the attack was revealed, Marsune reconsidered his isolationism, and decided to lend a hand.  Boss Rogoe's use of deception to gain the advantage on Boss Gallo rankled Marsune's sense of fair play.

His knowledge of the forest and battle-strategies proved indispensable, and his recruitment of the Bongomeken Collective turned the tide of the conflict.  Boss Gallo appointed Marsune first Captain of the newly-formed Gungan Grand Army.  Gungan children thereafter often played "Marsune and Gallo", recreating the exploits of the two leaders in the swamps and forests of Naboo.
