<i>By Dr. Spot</i> <br>
<br>
You've just spent the holidays penned up with the relatives in the cold of
winter, bored out of your mind. Turns out some cousins have a banjo and a
washboard. They're no great shakes, but they got music in their veins. A jam
session sounds a whole lot better than listening to your aunt talk about her
irregularity. Diligent inquiry turns up an old flattop from the back of a
closet. It looks OK but plays like a dog. With a few clues and a little cou=
rage
you could get that thing up and running. Here are the clues. <br>
<br>
<b>Don't Expect Miracles</b> <br>
In general, setting up an acoustic guitar is a trade-off between sound and
playability. By and large, big strings and high action make better sound and
worse playability. Don't start with the delusion that you're going to set t=
he
thing up to play like a cherry Strat. It ain't gonna happen. Slap a set of =
.10s
on that big ol' flattop and you're going to have problems. The head will pu=
ll
back, the strings will be too close to the neck, and you'll have buzz city.=
 So
be reasonable. Light acoustic strings&#8212;say .12 to .54&#8212;are about =
the
lightest strings you can go with and still get a decent tone out of your
soundboard. Remember, all of your sound is coming from the mechanical actio=
n of
those strings against that board. You need some tension and some
leverage&#8212;you need decent-sized strings. <br>
<br>
<b>Check For Big Problems</b> <br>
Tune the guitar to pitch, leave your hand off the neck, and do some hard
strumming on the open strings to listen for buzzes. If the strings are buzz=
ing
hard against the frets, you've got trouble. Either some idiot has cranked t=
he
truss rod way too hard (and probably damaged something inside) or the neck =
is
majorly warped. You can try loosening the truss rod, but chances are you'll
have to take it to a pro (where the prognosis probably won't be favorable).=
 <br>
<br>
If something is buzzing around the headstock, be sure it's not just an uncut
string, then make sure the nuts that hold the tuners on and the screws on t=
he
back are tight. If there's a buzz on the soundboard, it's either a foreign
object inside, a loose pickguard, or&#8212;more likely&#8212;a loose or cra=
cked
brace inside. If you can find the problem with a compact mirror and a
flashlight, you may be able to glue it up yourself with wood glue or even t=
he
gel type of cyanoacrylate (Super Glue). The advantage of the cyanoacrylate =
is
that you can hold the thing tight till it dries (but be careful not to glue
your fingers to the inside of your guitar). If in doubt, take it to a pro. =
<br>
<br>
<b>Straighten The Neck</b> <br>
The truss rod is located inside the neck in a groove beneath the fretboard.=
 It
runs the length of the neck and when you tighten it you pull the headstock =
back
causing the middle of the fretboard to come closer to the strings. In most
acoustic guitars you'll find the part of the truss rod you're after inside =
the
sound hole just beneath the end of the fretboard. You'll need the right siz=
e of
Allen wrench to adjust it. <br>
<br>
Point the head of the guitar away from you with the body at eye level and s=
ight
down the fretboard. Ideally you will see no curvature to the fretboard at a=
ll.
If there's a bow so that the middle of the fretboard is visibly farther away
from the strings than the ends, tighten the truss rod in 1/4 turns clockwise
until the neck looks straight. If there are obvious twists or bumps in the
fretboard, you may have to take it to a pro. Whatever you do, DON'T start
filing frets, you'll just get yourself into a world of trouble. <br>
<br>
If the neck is bowed so that the middle of the fretboard is closer to the
strings than the ends, try loosening the truss rod. If this doesn't make an
immediately visible change, you're probably out of luck. In any event DON'T
LOOSEN OR TIGHTEN THE TRUSS ROD MORE THAN A COMPLETE TURN! If you break som=
ething
in there, your guitar will need major work. <br>
<br>
To check your neck adjustment, press the low E string down at both the first
and last frets. There should be a tiny gap&#8212;around a 64th of an
inch&#8212;between the string and the middle frets. Repeat the same thing on
the high E string. This should give you a clue if you're in the ballpark and
also reveal any special problems. Don't be terribly alarmed if the gap is
somewhat bigger; it might be because the fretboard takes a bit of a turn wh=
ere
it meets the top of the guitar. <br>
<br>
<b>Adjust The Saddle</b> <br>
Sighting down the neck again, see how far you can press your high E string =
down
toward the body and still have clearance off the fretboard. If you can go m=
ore
than an eighth of an inch or so, and the neck looks straight, you can proba=
bly
bring the action down a bit without ill effect. But if it plays just fine f=
or
you, leave it alone. A little room for the strings to move is a good thing.=
 As
a general guide, you want the high E string about 5/64ths of an inch off the
12th fret and the low E about 7/64ths. But use your own judgement. If it bu=
zzes
too much, bring it up. If it's too hard to play, bring it down. <br>
<br>
The piece of hard white plastic that inserts in the little slot on the brid=
ge
of your guitar is called the saddle or the bridge nut. Don't do anything to=
 the
top of this, you'll only screw it up. To bring the action up, you'll need a
shim under the bridge nut. You can make one of these out of any number of t=
hin,
flat substances. I usually use the top of a butter tub. With a razor-type
knife, cut a piece out of the butter tub lid the exact dimensions of the br=
idge
nut's footprint. Tuck it in the slot under the bridge nut and tune back up.=
 If
the buzzing is gone, you're done. If not, try another shim. If that still
doesn't work, try loosening the truss rod a little. <br>
<br>
If the action can stand to go down, you'll have to file the bottom off the
bridge nut. Being very careful to hold the bottom of the nut perfectly flat,
file it down uniformly across the bottom. Don't take off more than about 1/=
16th
of an inch before trying it to see how it works. If you take too much off,
you'll have to shim it. If you totally destroy it, don't despair; bridge nu=
ts
are pretty easy to come by. Whatever you do, don't try to lower the action =
by
filing the grooves in the head nut (at the top of the fretboard). Other than
widening the gap slightly for a string that's real sticky, you generally wa=
nt
to leave head nut adjustments to a pro. <br>
<br>
<b>Close Enough</b> <br>
Don't get obsessive. You'll always have SOME string buzz, that's the nature=
 of
fretted instruments. And you'll never get the action extremely low without =
more
string buzz. It's not an exact science, but it's also not rocket science. W=
ith
careful, small adjustments almost any old guitar can be made to play and/or
sound better without resorting to professional repairs.</span></p>
