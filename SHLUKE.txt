<B>Luke Skywalker<B>

Luke Skywalker is likely the most famous hero of the Galactic Civil War, and the New Republic's foremost Jedi Knight.  His exploits are legendary, beginning with his humble farmboy origins, and ending with his role in the downfall of the Empire itself. Skywalker went on to combat the New Republic's enemies, and found a Jedi Praxeum on Yavin 4.  His skills are in constant demand, despite the resurgence of Force-adepts throughout the galaxy.

Skywalker's father was the feared Darth Vader, a respected and powerful Jedi at one time.  The Emperor had foreseen that Vader's progeny would destroy him, and so, at Luke and Leia's birth, the twins were separated and hidden.  Luke was raised by Owen Lars on the planet Tatooine, and watched from afar by Ben Kenobi.  He eventually found his way to the old Jedi, and then to ancient teacher Yoda.  It was Yoda who completed Skywalker's training and pronounced him a Jedi Knight.

After the last confrontation with his father, Luke continued to increase his knowledge of the Force.  He sought out young students for his academy, attempting to re-establish the Jedi Order, with very little information about its first incarnation.  In addition, he trained his sister Leia to use her own latent but powerful Force ability.  Luke Skywalker's efforts honored the proud tradition of the Jedi Knights.
