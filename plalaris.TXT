<B>Alaris Prime<B>

Alaris Prime, a small moon, hidden by a large gas giant, and thus, undeveloped and ignored for eons, lies on the outer arm of the Kashyyyk system. Alaris is characterized by thick forests, temperate oceans, and the occasional stand of wroshyr trees. 

The Wookiees have many legends about how the immense wroshyr tree, native to Kashyyyk, migrated across the vacuum of space to Alaris, but no definite theory has emerged.

Alaris Prime was discovered independently by Wookiee explorers, who petitioned the Galactic Senate to allow colonization. The Republic endeavors to prevent territorial disputes, dispensing colonization rights slowly and deliberately. A resource-rich planet, capable of supporting numerous races, Alaris Prime was finally awarded to the Wookiees after two decades of deliberation.

 The Trade Federation expressed an interest in the small moon, no doubt forecasting that Alaris Prime could be an important way-station for trade between Kashyyyk, Bimmissari, and even Kessel.  The Wookies, as rightful settlers, however, took issue and defended their territory, along with two Jedi sent from Coruscant.
