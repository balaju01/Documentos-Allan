;
; To run this installer in quiet mode:
; 1. Edit the information below to match your company information and install location.
; 2. Run : setup.exe <path to this file> /q /AcceptLicenses yes. Passing the value "yes"
;    to the /AcceptLicenses parameter indicates that you agree with the license agreements.

;    To prevent the restart use the command line : setup.exe <path to this file> /r:n /q /AcceptLicenses yes
