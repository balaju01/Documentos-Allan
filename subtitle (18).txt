We talked about how at
the beginning of this century, major labels made an effort to make their
contracts more transparent and simpler. However, the contracts are still evolving,
and, as a result of internet streaming and the digital age taking shape,
they're becoming even more complex. This lesson talked about
how artists are paid. The royalties based on retail or
wholesale. Royalties being paid on
third party licenses when recordings are used in commercial,
TV shows, or movies. Streaming royalties, although small now, becoming a more important
revenue stream as time goes on. We talked about advances, why it's
important to get an advance if you can. It's important for record companies to understand how
much they should pay in advances. We also talked about newer
provisions in recording agreements. The 360 degree deal model, which is
becoming all prevalent in our industry. Where the record companies are able to
participate in earnings from the artist from various revenue streams. And lastly, this is the most important
time as this digital age evolves. It's a great time for artists to build
their own assets, own their own assets. Own their sound recordings,
own their video recordings, exploit them through all of the various
internet sources they can to build that audience and grow the value
of the assets of their company. And this gets back to the very
point I made earlier. Instead of DIY, do it yourself, recognize
that you're going to need a team. DIO. Do it Ourselves. Get a team that can help you build and
own your own company and own your own assets, and exploit them in
the way that will build your business.
