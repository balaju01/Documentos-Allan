<B>General Maximilian Veers<B>

General Maximilian Veers is best known as the victorious leader of the Imperial forces at the Battle of Hoth.  One of the few generals to ever please Darth Vader, Veers competently led his walkers and ground troops past Rebel defensive positions and conquered the ice base, destroying the shield generator and allowing Vader to land and enter.  Despite fierce opposition from Rebel snowspeeders, Veers managed to capture and hold the base securely until the Dark Lord arrived.

It is still a widely-held belief that though General Veers was not expecting the snowspeeders to use a new tactic and snare his walkers in their tow-cables, his battlefield expertise led him to space the walkers far apart, and allow them to cover each other's flanks, making the Rebels' job that much more difficult.  Though a weakness in the AT-AT was discovered and exploited, General Veers' strategy minimized the impact, and prevented a military disaster.

The history of the walker is long and complex, but later models benefited from then-Colonel Veers' technical expertise and foresight.  Veers contributed greatly to the redesign of the later walkers, strengthening their armor-plating and improving their maneuverability.
