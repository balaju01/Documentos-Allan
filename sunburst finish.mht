cleaning, a small ebony sanding block was used to lightly sand away any

 the
washers. The tubing can be bent to reach normally inaccessible areas. After
sanding the interior, any remaining stain spots were brushed with bleach to

The moisture gets into the paint when the paint is sprayed during periods of

water to move slowly through the finish and most times the blushing will
disappear as the finish dries. Blushing can also be removed through sanding=
. It
can also be removed by spraying the finish with straight lacquer thinner. (=
Some
finishers add a small amount of retarder to the thinner). If the moisture is
trapped deeply in the finish you made need to use a product called &quot;Bl=

Eraser&quot;. Blush Eraser reconstitutes the lacquer to allow the moisture =

escape. Behlen makes the most popular eraser and provides it in an
aerosol.&nbsp;</span><span style=3D'color:black'> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span><span style=3D'font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black'>Pin h=

can be caused by a number of factors. The most common are contamination of =
the
wood by wax or silicon (Armor All used on the case or plastic parts can be a
source of this type of contamination), temperature changes during the spray=

most cases. Wiping with naphtha will also help in removing contamination.
Temperature can also play a role in the formation of pinholes. If a guitar =

has been in a cool environment&nbsp; then sprayed (as might be the case if =
you
are spraying in an unheated garage) and after spraying moved into a warm
environment to dry, air bubbles may form as the wood warms and push their w=

through the lacquer leaving pinholes. The last frequent cause (and probably
most common) is moisture in the wood. Water can get into the wood through
washing stripper from the wood, wet sanding primer or sealer coats or not
allowing a water based filler or water based dye enough time to dry.&nbsp;<=
