<B>Zaloriis<B>

The desolate planet of Zaloriis is notable only for its role in the production of the Imperial All-Terrain Armored Transports.  General Veers worked extensively to improve and update the walker design, but his research was interrupted by a Rebel uprising.

Zaloriis City is considered the main settlement, but even that is not a popular destination on the barren sandy rock.  The high winds of Zaloriis keep life to a minimum, but the sheltering boulders of the Fantain Mountains harbor smaller creatures and rock-lions.  Legends speak of dune ghosts that wander the wastes at night, and of travelers who never return from their journeys.  The natives respect the open deserts and keep well away from them, clustering in small outposts connected by well-traveled roads.

The Imperials recognized the value of the Zaloriians' fear-it allowed them to establish a research base out in the desert, with little concern for prying eyes.  In fact, their test vehicles often bolstered the legends and tall-tales, as wanderers spotted the strange technologies being tested and reported back exaggerated accounts at the local tavern.  One tale that amused the Imperial counter-spy network involved a man being confronted by a wheezing 50-foot dune-cow, with giant tusks and a grey reptilian hide.  Back at the research base, the prototype walker was quickly rechristened "Dune Cow."
