<B>Krant<B>

Located in the crowded center of the Both system, Krant is a newly-colonized planet thick with temperate forests and cliffs.  The trees of Krant are a spectacular multi-colored variety, which glow in the diffuse sunsets and shed their enormous leaves in two seasonal cycles.  The predators of Krant are few and far between, leaving a large ecological niche in which herbivores and insects  thrive. The Krantian songbirds fill the night sky with their calls and melodies, making for a bucolic, if noisy, setting for the newly-arrived colonists.  The two major cities are Peche and Thennes, both mainly agricultural in nature, but possessing small security forces.  

The proximity to Bothan homeworld Bothawui made this planet a strategic rendezvous point for Bothan spies and their contacts during the Galactic Civil War.  The Rebellion frequently used the planet in its desperate attempt to gather information on the Empire.  Although technically in 'neutral' space, Krant was scouted by the Empire several times for possible base locations.  And the interest of Imperial Moff Yittreas meant the Rebels' safe haven became more and more dangerous.
