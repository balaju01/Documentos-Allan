<B>Forest Moon of Endor<B>

Located in the remote Endor system in the Moddell sector, Endor is a massive gas giant orbited by nine moons, the largest of which is alternately known as the Sanctuary Moon, the Forest Moon, or simply Endor. The moon's landscape is dominated by vast expanses of giant forests, broken by grasslands, small oceans, secluded lakes, and mountain ranges.  The climate on the Forest Moon is temperate and mild, with polar caps regulating the sea levels.  

The Endor system itself is rarely traveled because the gas giant exerts complex gravitational forces on hyperspace lanes, and star-charts contain little helpful information for navigating the sector.  Due to its remote location, the Empire chose to build the second Death Star in the Endor system. To defend the superweapon during construction, Imperial engineers installed a protective shield generator on the Forest Moon..  The Emperor allowed information about the second Death Star to reach the Rebellion, hoping to trap the Alliance near Endor. When Rebel saboteurs arrived on the forest moon to destroy the shield generator, they were ambushed by a garrison of the Empire's elite stormtroopers. 

Fortunately, the Emperor's plans backfired when the native Ewoks rose up against the Imperials.The Empire had previously determined that the natives were 'harmless' and were ill-prepared to combat the furry warriors. The Ewoks helped free the Rebel strike team led by Han Solo and Princess Leia, who then went on to disable the shield generator.  With the shield down, Lando Calrissian and Wedge Antilles attacked and destroyed the Death Star, thus signaling the end of the Galactic Civil War and a return to freedom for the galaxy.

As a note of curiosity, years later, Princess Leia would return to the site and be chilled to feel the lingering dark side energy of the slain Emperor, circling the planet in ghostly orbit.
