<B>Han Solo<B>

The pirate captain Han Solo only meant to make a few credits delivering an old man and a farm boy to Alderaan.  He never bargained on spending the next few years of his life running from the Empire and eventually helping strike the death blow against its second Death Star.

The Corellian's past is shrouded in mystery, but he appears to have been a graduate of the Imperial Academy, and an officer in the Imperial Navy.  After rescuing his friend Chewbacca from Imperial slavers, he began the life of a smuggler and gambler.  Han and Chewie won the Millenium Falcon from fellow rogue Lando Calrissian, and set off to earn credits smuggling spice along the Kessel Run.  It was Solo's unfortunate run-in with an Imperial patrol that set in motion the important events to come.  The pirate was forced to dump a large shipment of Jabba the Hutt's spice, and consequently owed the crime lord the lost credits.

Obi-Wan Kenobi offered him the kind of payment he was looking for, and Solo jumped at the seemingly simple job.  After being pulled aboard the Death Star, Solo found himself talked into more trouble.  Luke Skywalker had a plan to rescue a rich princess, and the promised reward money whet Solo's appetite for adventure.  However, the spirited, independent princess was more trouble than any reward, in Solo's estimation.  

The attractive young woman later proved to be a key factor in Solo's continuing involvement with the Rebel Alliance, and would figure prominently in his later life-as his wife and mother of his children.
