<B>Mara Jade<B>

She was the Emperor's secret weapon.  The dread Lord Darth Vader was undoubtedly the Emperor's most visible ally, enforcing his will throughout the galaxy.  But from the shadows emerged another dark servant:  The Emperor's Hand, a little-known agent used for duties so secret, so subtle, Lord Vader would not suffice.

Mara was chosen by the Emperor for her burgeoning Force abilities, which he enhanced as he trained her.  She was used as a spy, as a saboteur, and a seductive assassin whenever necessary.  As the Emperor's Hand, she could telepathically sense his commands, even from across the galaxy.  Her most important mission took place on Tatooine, where she infiltrated the palace of Jabba the Hutt as a dancer named "Arica."  Her mission was to kill Luke Skywalker, but the Jedi escaped and went on to destroy the Emperor and his second Death Star.

Now without a master and without a job, Mara drifted through the galaxy, finally finding employment with Talon Karrde's smuggling operation.  Unbeknownst to him, her past haunted her constantly.  She felt she could hear the Emperor's ghostly last command:  "Kill Luke Skywalker."  As fate would have it, she got her chance when Talon Karrde captured the young Jedi as part of a greater plan.  But Mara found herself in a grudging alliance with the Jedi when the two became the target of an Imperial hunt.

The relationship grew, and eventually blossomed into love.  But it was a long metamorphosis.  Mara continued to wander the galaxy, trying to reconcile her Force abilities with her past.  She accepted missions from Mon Mothma, and trained very briefly with Kyle Katarn, whom she then rescued from the dark side, deep within a Sith temple.   She returned to the Alliance, and eventually settled down and accepted Skywalker's proposal of marriage.
