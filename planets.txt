<B>Planets<B>

The galaxy is a vast and largely-uncharted network of systems, suns and planets.  Throughout its history, the Old Republic, the Trade Federation, the Empire, and the New Republic have all, at one time or another, occupied many of its diverse and unique worlds.  Each has a distinct geography and history, but all are somehow intertwined with the galactic story of conquest and liberty.
