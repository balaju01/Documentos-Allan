<B>Viceroy Nute Gunray<B>

Nute Gunray was the Commanding Viceroy and member of Trade Federation Executive Board , a fact he let no one forget for even a moment.  Greedy, fearful, and evil, Gunray typified the worst in Neimoidian characteristics.  His occupation and abuse of Naboo was the pinnacle of a career built on intimidation and deceit.

Neimoidian personalities can be largely explained through their social system.  Neimoidians begin life as helpless grubs placed in communal hives.  The grubs fight with each other for a limited supply of food, and the successful learn to hoard and steal.  By age seven, only the worst have survived.  As they graduate from the hives, Neimoidians begin to work in the large hive complexes and huge fungus farms that dominate their planet.  The skills learned working and sustaining these endeavors actually give the Neimoidians quite a managerial edge on other species.  Their dominance in the Trade Federation is no surprise to anyone.

Like many Neimoidians, Nute Gunray wore a large headdress to signify his importance and power.  He forbade any of his colleagues to have a headdress taller than his, and there were frequent measuring and calibrating sessions to satisfy his ego.   In addition, Gunray purchased an opulent mechno-chair, revered by the Neimoidians as the height of ultimate wealth and power.  Gunray enjoyed the chair, as it reminded him of the floating repulsor-thrones of the Hutt lords.  One of his passions was the collection of Hutt art and sculpture.  Gunray considered the species to be a shining example of tasteful power and success.
