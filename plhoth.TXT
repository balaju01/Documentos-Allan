<B>Hoth<B>

Hoth is the sixth planet in a system of the same name, located along the Ison Corridor on the fringes of civilized space.  The planet's surface is one continuous plane of ice and snow, broken only by frozen mountain ridges and glaciers.  Curiously, its two main species are quite large, despite an apparent dearth of food.  The tauntaun is a furred-reptilian beast, covered in thick hair, and subsisting on lichen found in Hoth's many ice caves. Unfortunately for the tauntaun, its primary predator also resides in these caves.  The ferocious wampa boasts massive claws and teeth, and a dangerous reach of almost 2 meters.  Due to its hostile terrain and fauna, Hoth is not even listed on most star charts, making this an excellent choice for a Rebel base.

Discovered by Luke Skywalker, Hoth's remote location promised seclusion and safety for the beleaguered Rebels.  After a long galaxy-wide search, they settled at last in Hoth's snow caves and natural tunnels, receiving their food and supplies through smugglers and pirates like Dash Rendar.  But soon after they had  arrived, the Rebels began enduring constant wampa attacks.  Resourceful droid R2-D2 hit on a solution: a sonic lure was used to confuse and capture many of the creatures.  Unfortunately, a handful of wampas still prowled the high plains, and it was one of these that attacked Skywalker and his tauntaun.  Shortly after Luke's recovery, the Rebels were discovered by an Imperial probe droid, which beamed their position back to Lord Darth Vader.  The Dark Lord set plans in motion for an immediate invasion.
